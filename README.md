# PPE detection for workers with YOLOv8 and Streamlit

A deep learning-based project to enhance workplace safety by detecting Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) like helmets, vests, masks, and gloves in real-time. Built using Python, OpenCV, and YOLO for accurate object detection. This system ensures compliance, generates alerts for non-compliance, and supports customization for various industries.
