# PPE detection for workers with YOLOv8 and Streamlit

This repository is a comprehensive open-source project that demonstrates the integration of object detection and tracking using the YOLOv8 object detection algorithm and Streamlit, a popular Python web application framework for building interactive web applications. This project provides a user-friendly and customizable interface that can detect and track objects in real-time video streams.

## Demo WebApp

This app is up and running on Streamlit cloud server!!! Thanks 'Streamlit' for the community support for the cloud upload. You can check the demo of this web application on the link below.
